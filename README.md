# TIC-TAC-TOE Multiplayer game.

This project aims to develop a multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game using socket programming in Python. The game will be played over a local network or the internet, where two players can connect to a server and play against each other in real-time. The project will use the Python programming language and the socket module to establish a connection between the clients and the server.
